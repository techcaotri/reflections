What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do that?
	When initializing a repository, git creates a hidden directory ".git" which contains meta-data for the history of files. We need to do that because we must tell git that we're now using git to control the versions of files in this folder.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	The staging area is the temporary place where you add your files from the working directory and then commit them to the repository. It offer a place to review your files, your logic before committing them to the repository.
